  <h1 style="background-color:Black; color:White">Robert Frost: Nothing Gold Can Stay</h1>
  
  
<p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
  " Natureâ€™s first green is gold,"
<br>
  " Her hardest hue to hold."
<br>
  " But only so an hour."
<br>
  " Then leaf subsides to leaf."
<br>
  " So Eden sank to grief,"
<br>
  " So dawn goes down to day."
<br>  
  " Nothing gold can stay."
<br>

<h1 style="background-color:Black; color:White">Oscar Wilde: Symphony in Yellow</h1>  
  <p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
  " An omnibus across the bridge"
  <br>
 " Crawls like a yellow butterfly," 
  <br>
  " And, here and there, a passer-by"
    <br>
  " Shows like a little restless midge."
  <br>
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
  " The yellow leaves begin to fade"
  <br>
" And flutter from the Temple elms,"  
  <br>
" And at my feet the pale green Thames"  
  <br>
" Lies like a rod of rippled jade. "  
  <br>
